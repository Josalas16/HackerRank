# Arrays
# Problem
# The NumPy (Numeric Python) package helps us manipulate large arrays and matrices of numeric data.
# To use the Numpy module, we need to import it using:
# import numpy as np

# Arrays
# A Numpy array is a grid of values. They are similar to lists, except that every element of an array
# must be the same type

# Example
# import numpy as np
# a = np.arraya([1,2,3,4,5])
# print(a[1] # 2

# b = np.array([1,2,3,4,5],float)
# print(b[1]) # 2.0
# In the above example, np.array() is used to convert a list into a Numpy array. The
# second argument (float) can be used to set the type of array elements.

# Task
# You are given a space separated list of numbers.
# Your task is to print a reversed NumPy array with the element type float.

# Input Format
# A single line of input containing space separated numbers.

# Output Format
# Print the reverse NumPy array with type float.

# Sample Input
# 1 2 3 4 - 8 -10

# Sample Output
# [-10. -8. 4. 3. 2. 1.]
